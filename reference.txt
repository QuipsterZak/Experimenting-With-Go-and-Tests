---Go Environment---
Modules solves problems related to dependency management, version selection and reproducible builds, aswell as running Go code outside of `GOPATH`.
command: `go mod init`


---Intro---
Writing tests is like writing functions, with a few rules:
-File name should be "xxx_test.go"
-Test function must start with the word "Test"
-The test function takes one argument only `t *testing.T`
-Import "testing" beforehand

the `f` in t.Errorf stands for format which allows to build a string with values inserted into the placeholder values %q.

Go doc can be launched locally by running `godoc -http :8000`, packages location is in localhost:8000/pkg
Check: http://localhost:8000/pkg/testing/
if go doc is not available(newer versions) we can install it with `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc@latest`
